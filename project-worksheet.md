## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evaluate game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| A: WireFrame and Ideas                            | H | 7 hrs | 5 hrs | 5 hrs |
| B: Retouch old projects                           |    M     | 3hrs| 0 hrs | 0 hrs |

## Code Snippet I am proud of

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

```javascript
function app(projects) {
  projects.forEach(project => {
    console.log(project);
    let $projectsContainer = $("#projects-container");
    let $projectContent = $(`
      <div class="project-item slide">
        <a href="${project.url}" target="_blank" class="project-link">
          <h2 class="project-title">
            ${project.title}
          </h2>
        </a>
        <div class="project-img-container">
            <img src="./imgs/spaceship.png" alt="" class="project-spaceship" />
            <a href="${project.url}" target="_blank" class="project-link">
              <img src="${project.image}" alt="" class="project-img" />
            </a>
        </div>
        <a href="${project.github}" target="_blank">(Github)</a>
      </div>
    `);
    $projectsContainer.append($projectContent);
  });
```

- This was code using jQuery to insert project items into the projects carousel.
- I'm proud of it for the HTML structure and template strings used to insert data from the Google API.

## Issues and Resolutions

 Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.

#### Navbar covering section
**ERROR**: Navbar covers header sections when clicking on anchors.                             
**RESOLUTION**: Added an empty div, with the height the same as the navbar's height.

#### Navbar drop-down is transparent

**ERROR**: Navbar drop-down is transparent                         
**RESOLUTION**: Set **nav** background to a color.

#### Full screen section overflows with content

**ERROR**: If, say, you collapse the browser window vertically, then content overfi                           
**RESOLUTION**: Used **min-height: 100vh** to allow page section to expand with content.

#### Section content needs to be centered

**ERROR**: Can't vertically, and horizontally center content per section.                    
**RESOLUTION**: Set section to **display: flex; flex-direction: collumn; justify-content: center; align-items: center;**.

#### Projects carousel collapses its height when loading projects using jQuery

**ERROR**: Projects carousel collapses its height when loading projects using jQuery.                           
**RESOLUTION**: Created an empty object statically into HTML, and set visibility to invisible. This hack worked, and the carousel displayed correctly.
